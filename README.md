# tremor-games-api

This API was for Tremor Games, I am releasing it now because the website was shut down on the 25th of November 2018. Tremor Games had no real API so this is just a wrapper for sending requests to the website as if you were logged in, I was not sure if this was against their ToS so I didn't release the code.

Tremor games was a website that users could earn points by doing stuff such as playing games, doing surveys, downloading apps and refering users to the site. These points could be exchanged for rewards such as Steam games and Amazon gift cards.

I refered over 70 thousand users to this website and exchanged the points I earned for a few thousand Amazon gift cards. I wanted to welcome users I refered to the website and give them tips/FAQ and also have a simple chat bot that would respond to common questions. To achive this I created this API for the website that was used by my other scripts.
